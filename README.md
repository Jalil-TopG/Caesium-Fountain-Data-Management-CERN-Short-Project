# Caesium Fountain Data Management â€“ CERN Short Project

This project, completed during a CERN summer program, focuses on improving the data acquisition and accessibility of caesium fountain atomic clock measurements. It supports the **ALPHA experiment**, which studies hydrogen vs anti-hydrogen transition frequencies as part of the search for matter-antimatter asymmetry.

## Project Summary

- Developed a data acquisition and logging system for **caesium fountain clock** operations
- Used **LabVIEW** to gather:
  - Pressure and current values from vacuum systems
  - Temperature readings from thermocouples via a **Pico TC-08** logger
- Integrated data into the **MIDAS** database for efficient storage and retrieval
- Enhanced access to **hyperfine structure** data for anti-hydrogen research

## Tools & Technologies

- **LabVIEW**: graphical programming for instrument control and data flow
- **Pico TC-08**: thermocouple data logger
- **MIDAS Database**: CERN's data acquisition backend
- **Virtual PC environment**: protected system integration testing

## Key Concepts

- **Caesium Fountain Clock**: one of the most precise atomic clocks, used to probe transition frequencies
- **Ramsey Method**: high-precision resonance detection for hyperfine splitting
- **Anti-Hydrogen Spectroscopy**: comparing matter and antimatter frequency spectra

## Report

All implementation details, system descriptions, and LabVIEW code diagrams are included in the final technical report [here]
